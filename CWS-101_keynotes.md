## Chapter 1 - Radio Frequency (RF)

- Radio frequency (RF) waves are used to transmit and receive data on WLANs.
- The wavelength of a wave is related to its frequency: higher frequencies correspond with shorter wavelengths, and lower frequencies correspond with longer wavelengths.
- The amplitude of a wave is the power or strength of the wave.
- The phase of a wave is a comparative attribute that relates one wave to another.
- Waves may be *in phase*  with other waves or, to some degree, out of phase with other waves.
- Modulation uses phase shifts (PSK) and amplitude shifts (ASK) in WLANs.
- RF waves are reflected off obstacles that are large in relation to their wavelengths and that have reflective properties.
- Many materials absorb some of the RF energy of the waves as the waves pass through them.
- RF transmission power is often referenced in watts (W) or milliwatts (mW), but received signal strength is tipically referenced in dBm.
- 802.11 devices use a modulation and coding scheme (MCS) to achieve the data rate in the link.
- In addition to the modulation and coding, the channel width and the number of spatial streams impact the achievable data rate.
