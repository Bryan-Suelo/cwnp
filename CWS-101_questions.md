# Chapter 1 - Radio Frequency (RF)

1. **What denotes the strength of an RF wave or signal?**
   
   _Amplitude_
   > The amplitude is the strength or power of the RF wave.

2. **What is decreased as the frequency of a wave increases?**
   
   _Wavelength_
   > As the frequency increases, the wavelength decreases. Alternatively, as the wavelength increases, the frequency decreases.

3. **What RF behavior is similar to ligth waves as seen in a mirror?**
   
   _Reflection_
   > Reflection occursin RF waves as well as ligth waves and is analogous to ligth in a mirror.

4. **What kind of modulation is not used in WLANs?**
   
   _Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)_
   > FSK is not used in WLANs. Both ASK and PSK are used, and BPSK is a form of PSK modulation.

5. **What is the name of the scheme that determines data rates in WLANs?**
   
   _Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)_
   > The MCS determines the data rates that are available. It is a factor of modulation, coding, channel width and spatial streams, among other variables.

6. **What happens when RF energy is converted to heat when passing through some materials?**
   
   _Absorption_
   > Absorption occurs when RF energy is converted to heat, and the result is an attenuation of the RF signal as it exists the absorbing  medium.

7. **What modulation type uses _Phase Shift Keying_?**
   
   _BPSK_
   > All Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) types use both ASK and  PSK. BPSK and QPSK are the two modulation techniques that only use PSK.

8. **In addition to modulation and coding, what other two primary factors impact the data rate that is achievable in a WLAN link?**
   
   _Channel width and number of spatial streams_
   > The channel width impacts the data rate, and wider channel widths support higher data rates. The number of spatial streams also impacts the data rate. More spatial streams with the same or better signal quality results in higher data rates.

9. **What other comparative attribute relates an RF wave to another wave in the same channel?**
    
    _Phase_
    > The phase of an RF wave is an attribute that compares one wave with another wave. They can either be 'in phase' or, to some degree, out of phase.

10. **What metric is preferred by engineers and is used to represent received signal strength?**

    _dBm_ 
    > While RSSI is a common metric as well, engineers prefer dBm because it is an absolute power measurement, whereas RSSI is arbitrary and unique specified by WLAN vendors.
